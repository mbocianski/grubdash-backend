# grubdash-backend


This project is the backend of a food ordering application.

I built the server using Node and Express in order to connect data to the [frontend of the project](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end).

You do not need to see the frontend for this project to work.

## How to Install

- Fork and clone the repo
- Run npm install
- run npm start


## Learnings

This project focused on the development of complex validation middleware with an express server. Using separate databases for both dishes and orderes, the server successfully handles RESTful requests for various routes. This helped me gain a better understanding of using Express and developing a server. 

Highlights includes:

- Writing customer validation middleware functions
- - Building an API following RESTful design principles
- Error handling for invalid methods and routes
- Receiving requests through routes
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
